** Important Note: **
As of V2.2 I removed the support restriction removal patch, this is due to me not having the time to find the new code in the new game update. I might attempt to find it at a later point but for now its removed.



CHOOSE 1 OF THESE METHODS ONLY.

** DLL method **

1. Download t4bby's DLL Loader: https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/372
2. Read the Instructions to install t4bby's loader and create the Plugins folder as it says.
3. Download PalPatcher.dll and place it in the Plugins folder you created.

Note: As far as I know you can also my dll using the dll loader functionality of UE4SS, but I cannot confirm that and will not offer support on how to do that as I havnt looked into it.

** DragNDrop EXE Patcher **

This hopefully will support patching the executable on linux(not tested) and windows.
This script doesnt need to be placed anywhere specific, just do 1 of these 2 ways of executing it.

Use this by 1 of 2 methods:

1. Drag and dropping the game executable file onto the script.( if just patching palworld, you only need to patch "Palworld-Win64-Shipping.exe", if your patching Palserver you need to do both executables "PalServer-Win64-Test-Cmd.exe" and "PalServer-Win64-Test.exe"

OR

2. Call the script in a terminal window with the file to be patched as an argument. IE: "python BuildPatcher.py /path/to/PalServer-Win64-Test-Cmd" 



**FAQ:**

1. **Difference from CactusPi3's files:**
   - Cactus's files edit the game's memory address after loading, while my patcher files apply mods/patches before the game launches.

2. **DragNDrop special file placement:**
   - Run it from anywhere...

3. **Recommended version and patch method:**
   - I HIGHLY suggest you use the DLL version, as it has the best safegaurds in place.
   
4. **Do I need cheat engine or .CT files:**
   - No.
   
5. **Do i need to use the exe patcher and use the dll:**
   - No, only choose 1 method. Infact if you try to use them both the dll will not be able to find the bytes to patch as they were already patched using the exe patcher
   
6. **The DragNDrop file doesnt do anything!!**
   - Did you install python and make sure to check the box on the bottom of the installer that said "add python to PATH"? If not you need to do that then the python script will be able to be launched/used

7. **What happened to the GUI patcher, Downloader and the support restriction removal?
   -Ok this has a few things,
   
      1. I removed support for the gui patcher as I feel the DragNdrop script is just as simple to use but doesnt require me trying to find the path to the executable. I also removed support for the downloader for the same reason, I made that to try making it easier for those that cant seem to figure out how to make a folder and put the dll into it. But as of right now I dont feel like maintaining multiple files.
   
      2. When the game updated to V0.2 they changed the way the support restriction check is performed, and as of the writing of this I dont have the time to try finding the new code. (and tbh I lost alot of my motivation as I dont really play the game that much right now until more content gets added.)
