**Important Note:**
Using the mod/patch to remove support restrictions can be risky. If you build a base with the mod/patch applied and later accidentally run the game without it, your base will be destroyed. Be cautious and ensure the patch is always applied before loading your save/world.

**DLL Version**

- Prerequisites: make sure your game exe and server exe are clean and unmodified. So if you used my exe patcher or python script to permanently patch the exe you must restore the exe first.

1. Download t4bby's DLL Loader: https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/372
2. Download PalPatcher.dll and place it in the plugins directory you created for the Loader
3. Your done :)

Notes: PalPatcher.dll has 2 safety checks built in to protect your base. first it makes sure the exe of the game/server is the supported version, second if the patches for some reason fail to get applied, if either fail then the game/server will be forcefully closed and you will be told it happened.
If this happens, either try again incase the patching just failed for some reason. then if it still fails most likely the game has updated and you just had your base saved and should wait for an update to PalPatcher.

If you cant wait for an update and decide to remove PalPatcher then anything you placed with not enough support will get destroyed.

To uninstall PalPatcher you only need to delete the dll from the plugins directory.

**EXE GUI Version:**
1. Download BuildPatcher.exe and BuildPatcher.ini.
2. Open BuildPatcher.ini and set palworld_root and/or palserver_root to your game and/or server's root folder.
3. Delete any unwanted mods/patches in the ini.
4. Double-click/run BuildPatcher.exe and choose your method to modify the game and/or server.
   - For a temporary patch, run the patcher every time before playing.
   - For a permanent patch, click it once and close the patcher after a successful patch. You can then run the game normally.

*Note: This version also supports command line arguments. For example, "BuildPatcher.exe Temporary_Server" will start the EXE and auto-select the Temporary Server Patch option.*

**Python Command Line Version:**
- Prerequisites: Install Python from [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/) and ensure you select the option to add Python to PATH during installation.

1. Download BuildPatcher.py and BuildPatcher.ini.
2. Open BuildPatcher.ini and set palworld_root and/or palserver_root to your game's root folder.
3. Double-click the .py file or open a command window at the script location.
4. Choose one of the five options provided.

*Note: This version also supports command line arguments. For example, "python BuildPatcher.py 1" will start the script and auto-select option 1.*

**Permanent Method:**
- Use Steam or launch the game normally with this method.
- Be aware that if the game updates without your knowledge, loading your save/world might result in your entire base exploding due to lack of proper support.
- This method may be more convenient, but stay vigilant for game updates to avoid unpleasant surprises.

**Temporary Method:**
- This method requires running the game through the patcher every time, but it has a benefit.
- The patcher checks if the game's executable is the expected version. If it's not, you'll receive a warning.
- This warning means either the game updated and the patches/mods are no longer applied, or the patching process failed. Ignoring this warning and loading the game risks losing your base.

**FAQ:**
1. **Difference from CactusPi3's files:**
   - Cactus's files edit the game's memory address after loading, while my patcher files apply mods/patches before the game launches.

2. **Special file placement:**
   - Run it from anywhere. The INI must be with the .py or .exe file, and it should be edited to include your current root directory for the game and/or server.

3. **Recommended version and patch method:**
   - I HIGHLY suggest you use the DLL version, as it has the best safegaurds in place.
   
4. **Do I need cheat engine or .CT files:**
   - No.

5. **No server path in the INI:**
   - If you don't have the dedicated server installed, you can ignore the server functions and leave palserver_root in the INI unedited.

6. **I can't double click the .py file - help!!!**
   - You didn't select the option to add Python to the PATH when you installed Python. Either look up a guide on how to do it manually, or reinstall Python with that option checked.
