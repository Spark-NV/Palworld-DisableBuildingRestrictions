** Important Note: **
Using the mod/patch to remove support restrictions can be risky. If you build a base with the mod/patch applied and later accidentally run the game without it, your base will be destroyed. Be cautious and ensure the patch is always applied before loading your save/world.
This is the reason the DLL method is prefered as it always attempts to patch the game at startup and if it fails you will know, where as the patcher version if the game updates and you didnt realize it you risk attempting to build something without the patches in place.


With the latest release of this, I have made it so the locating of the steam installation and palworld/palserver installs are automatically found.
it does this by reading the windows registry to find the steam install location, it then reads the manifest files within the steam folder to find the game install directories.
It also does not require an ini anymore since the directories are found automatically




** Palpatcher Downloader method: **

just download the .bat file either from the nexusmods page or from the github repo and run it.
Select the option you want to have downloaded/installed. 
Option 1 will download and place the dll files into the proper directories for palworld and palserver(if you have palserver intalled).
Option 2 will download the patcher exe to the desktop for you to execute.
Option 9 will delete/uninstall the dll files from palworld and palserver(if palserver is installed)


** Manual DLL install method **

1. Download t4bby's DLL Loader: https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/372
2. Read the Instructions to install t4bby's loader and create the Plugins folder as it says.
3. Download PalPatcher.dll and place it in the Plugins folder you created.


** Manual EXE Patcher **

This really doesnt need instructions? as you just download the exe and run it then choose an option.
Each row has a "?" button which describes what that row's buttons functions kinda do.




**FAQ:**

1. **Difference from CactusPi3's files:**
   - Cactus's files edit the game's memory address after loading, while my patcher files apply mods/patches before the game launches.

2. **Special file placement:**
   - Run it from anywhere...

3. **Recommended version and patch method:**
   - I HIGHLY suggest you use the DLL version, as it has the best safegaurds in place.
   
4. **Do I need cheat engine or .CT files:**
   - No.
   
5. **Do i need to run the patcher and use the dll:**
   - No, only choose 1 method. Infact if you try to use them both the dll will not be able to find the bytes to patch as they were already patched using the patcher GUI
